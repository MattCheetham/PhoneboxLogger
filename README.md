## Requirements

Run the Xcode project and deploy to your iOS device

## Usage

Whenever you come across a phone box in bournemouth. Whip out the app, hit the `Add telephone box` button and follow the directions to send an email.

PLEASE NOTE: I have not inserted Sean's real email address, it's a dummy one for obvious reasons. Contact him for the real address.

P.S. Sean didn't ask me to do this and he probably doesn't want people to. Sorry Sean. I was bored and decided to do this anyway because I can.

HAPPY PHONEBOX MARKING
